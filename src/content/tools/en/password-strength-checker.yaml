intro: "How secure is the password you are using right now? This password strength checker analyzes your password entirely in your browser, never sending it to any server, and gives you an instant security score from 0 to 100. See estimated crack time against modern hardware, a detailed checklist of what makes a password strong, and specific suggestions to improve weak passwords. Whether you are creating a new account password, auditing your existing credentials, or teaching someone about password security, this tool provides clear, actionable feedback grounded in real cryptographic principles rather than vague advice."

  title: "How Password Strength Is Measured"
  content: "Password strength fundamentally comes down to entropy, the number of possible combinations an attacker would need to try in a brute force attack to guarantee finding your password. Entropy is measured in bits and calculated as the logarithm base 2 of the total number of possible passwords of a given length and character set. A password using only lowercase letters (26 possibilities per character) has less entropy per character than one using lowercase, uppercase, digits, and symbols (roughly 95 possibilities per character). Each additional character multiplies the total combinations, making length the single most important factor in password strength. Modern password attacks use multiple techniques beyond simple brute force. Dictionary attacks try common words and phrases. Rule-based attacks apply transformations like appending numbers, substituting letters with similar-looking symbols (a to @, e to 3), and capitalizing first letters. Credential stuffing uses passwords leaked from previous data breaches to try against other accounts, exploiting the fact that most people reuse passwords across services. This is why unique passwords matter as much as complex ones. A modern GPU-based cracking rig can test roughly 10 billion password hashes per second against common algorithms like MD5. Against properly salted bcrypt or argon2 hashes, the rate drops to thousands or tens of thousands per second, but many services still use weaker hashing. This checker estimates crack time assuming a fast hash scenario to give you a conservative worst case. The strength score in this tool evaluates multiple factors beyond raw length. It checks for character diversity across four categories (lowercase, uppercase, digits, special characters), penalizes common patterns like repeated characters or all-same-type passwords, and rewards length milestones at 8, 12, and 16 characters. These thresholds align with recommendations from NIST Special Publication 800-63B, which emphasizes password length over complexity rules and recommends checking passwords against lists of commonly used and breached passwords. The estimated crack time provides an intuitive way to understand your password strength. However, it assumes random character selection. If your password is based on a dictionary word, name, date, or keyboard pattern, the actual time to crack could be dramatically shorter because attackers try these patterns first. A truly random 16-character password using all character types would take billions of years to crack by brute force, while a 20-character password based on a common phrase might fall in hours to a sophisticated dictionary attack."
  formula: "Entropy (bits) = L x log2(N) where L = password length, N = character pool size"
  formulaExplanation: "N = 26 (lowercase) + 26 (uppercase) + 10 (digits) + 32 (symbols) = 94 for a full character set"

faqs:
  - question: "Is it safe to type my password into this tool?"
    answer: "Yes. This password strength checker runs entirely in your browser using JavaScript. Your password is never transmitted to any server, stored in any database, or logged in any way. You can verify this by disconnecting from the internet and using the tool offline, as it will function identically. The analysis happens instantaneously in your browser's memory and is discarded when you navigate away from the page. That said, as a general security practice, you should avoid typing real passwords into any online tool you do not trust completely. If you prefer, test a password that follows the same pattern as your real one but with different specific characters."
  - question: "What makes a password truly strong?"
    answer: "The strongest passwords combine length, randomness, and uniqueness. Length is the most important factor because each additional character exponentially increases the number of possible combinations. A random 16-character password using lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols has roughly 94 to the power of 16 possible combinations, which is approximately 3.7 times 10 to the 31st power. Randomness matters because attackers try predictable patterns first, including dictionary words, names, dates, and keyboard sequences. Uniqueness is critical because if one service gets breached and your password is exposed, unique passwords prevent attackers from accessing your other accounts."
  - question: "How long should my password be?"
    answer: "Current security best practices, including NIST SP 800-63B guidelines, recommend a minimum of 8 characters but strongly suggest 12 to 16 characters or longer. For high-value accounts like email, banking, and password managers, 16 or more characters provide excellent protection. A randomly generated 20-character password using all character types is essentially uncrackable by brute force with current or foreseeable technology. If you use a password manager, which security experts universally recommend, there is no practical downside to using 20 or even 30 character passwords since you never need to type them manually."
  - question: "Are passphrases better than complex passwords?"
    answer: "Passphrases, strings of random words like correct horse battery staple, can be very strong if they are long enough and the words are chosen randomly rather than forming a meaningful phrase. A four-word passphrase chosen randomly from a dictionary of 7,776 words provides about 51 bits of entropy, comparable to a random 8-character password. Five or six random words provide 64 to 77 bits, which is quite strong. The advantage of passphrases is memorability. The disadvantage is that some services impose maximum length limits or require specific character types. If you use passphrases, ensure the words are truly random and not a quote, song lyric, or common phrase, as attackers maintain databases of these."
  - question: "Should I change my password regularly?"
    answer: "Current NIST guidelines actually recommend against forced periodic password changes, reversing decades of conventional wisdom. Research shows that mandatory rotation leads people to make minimal, predictable changes like incrementing a number or changing one character, which provides little security benefit while creating user frustration. Instead, you should change your password when you have reason to believe it may have been compromised, such as after a data breach notification, suspicious account activity, or if you shared it with someone. The most impactful security improvement for most people is using unique passwords for every account combined with a password manager and two-factor authentication."
  - question: "What is two-factor authentication and should I use it?"
    answer: "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second verification step beyond your password, typically a time-based code from an authenticator app, a text message code, or a physical security key. Even if an attacker obtains your password through a breach or phishing, they cannot access your account without the second factor. You should enable 2FA on every account that supports it, especially email, banking, social media, and cloud storage. Authenticator apps like Google Authenticator, Authy, or 1Password are more secure than SMS codes, which can be intercepted through SIM swapping attacks. Hardware security keys like YubiKey provide the strongest protection available."

examples:
  - title: "Weak password test"
    scenario: "Testing the common password 'password123'"
    inputs:
      password: "password123"
    expectedResult: "Score: ~45/100 (Weak) | Missing uppercase and special characters"
    explanation: "The password 'password123' scores poorly despite being 11 characters long. It uses only lowercase letters and digits (2 of 4 character types), contains a dictionary word as the base, and follows the extremely common pattern of appending numbers to a word. Attackers specifically target this pattern in dictionary attacks, meaning the actual time to crack is far shorter than the brute-force estimate suggests. Adding uppercase letters and special characters would help, but replacing the entire password with a random string would be far more effective."
  - title: "Strong random password"
    scenario: "Testing a randomly generated password 'kR9#mNx2$pLw4!qZ'"
    inputs:
      password: "kR9#mNx2$pLw4!qZ"
    expectedResult: "Score: 100/100 (Very Strong) | All character types present, 16 characters"
    explanation: "This 16-character random password scores perfectly. It uses all four character types (lowercase, uppercase, digits, and special characters), exceeds the 16-character threshold, and has no repeating patterns. The estimated brute-force crack time is billions of years even against modern GPU hardware. This is the type of password a password manager would generate and store for you, providing maximum security without the need to memorize it."
  - title: "Medium-strength passphrase"
    scenario: "Testing the passphrase 'SunflowerBridge42'"
    inputs:
      password: "SunflowerBridge42"
    expectedResult: "Score: ~80/100 (Strong) | Good length but based on dictionary words"
    explanation: "This 17-character password scores well on technical metrics because it is long and uses three character types. However, it is composed of two dictionary words with a number appended, a pattern that sophisticated cracking tools specifically target. While it would resist brute-force attacks, a targeted dictionary or rule-based attack could potentially crack it more quickly than the raw character count suggests. Adding a special character between the words or replacing it with a fully random password would improve security significantly."
