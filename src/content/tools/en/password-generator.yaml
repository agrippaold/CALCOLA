intro: "Weak passwords remain the leading cause of account breaches. Studies show that the average person reuses the same password across multiple sites, which means a single data leak can expose dozens of accounts at once. This tool generates random passwords of any length using a cryptographically sound method, and it includes a strength meter so you can see exactly how resistant your password is to common attack methods like brute force and dictionary attacks."

  title: "How Password Generation Works"
  content: "A strong password draws from the largest possible pool of characters and arranges them in a sequence that has no predictable pattern. This generator builds passwords by randomly selecting characters from four groups: uppercase letters (A-Z, 26 characters), lowercase letters (a-z, 26 characters), digits (0-9, 10 characters), and special symbols (!@#$%^&* and similar, roughly 32 characters). When all four groups are active, the pool contains about 94 printable ASCII characters. The number of possible combinations for a password of length L drawn from a pool of size P equals P raised to the power of L. A 12-character password from a 94-character pool produces 94^12 combinations, which is approximately 4.76 times 10^23. At a rate of one billion guesses per second, brute-forcing this would take about 15,000 years on average. The strength meter in this tool estimates password entropy, measured in bits. Entropy equals L times log2(P). Each additional character adds log2(P) bits of entropy. With a 94-character pool, each character contributes roughly 6.55 bits. A 12-character password therefore has about 78.6 bits of entropy. Security researchers generally consider 60 bits the minimum for reasonable security and 80 bits or more as strong. The generator uses the Web Crypto API (crypto.getRandomValues) in your browser, which provides cryptographically secure pseudo-random numbers. Unlike Math.random(), which uses a deterministic algorithm that could theoretically be predicted, crypto.getRandomValues pulls from your operating system's entropy source. The password never leaves your browser. No server request is made, and nothing is stored or logged. You can verify this by disconnecting from the internet and confirming the tool still works."
  formula: "Entropy (bits) = L x log2(P)"
  formulaExplanation: "L is the password length in characters. P is the size of the character pool (the number of distinct characters the password can contain). The result tells you how many bits of randomness the password contains. Higher entropy means more guesses are required to crack it."

faqs:
  - question: "How long should a password be?"
    answer: "For most online accounts, 12 characters is a solid minimum when you include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and symbols. If you are protecting something high-value like a primary email account, a password manager vault, or a financial account, aim for 16 characters or more. Each additional character multiplies the number of possible combinations by the pool size (roughly 94 for full ASCII), making brute-force attacks exponentially harder. A 16-character password from the full pool has over 100 bits of entropy."
  - question: "Are longer passwords always better than complex ones?"
    answer: "Length and complexity both contribute to security, but length has a larger impact. A 20-character password made of only lowercase letters (26^20 combinations) is stronger than an 8-character password using all character types (94^8 combinations). That said, the best approach is to use both length and complexity together. A 16-character password from the full 94-character pool gives you roughly 105 bits of entropy, which is beyond the reach of any current brute-force method. Avoid sacrificing one for the other when you have the option to use both."
  - question: "Should I use a different password for every account?"
    answer: "Absolutely. If you reuse a password and one service gets breached, attackers will try that same email and password combination on hundreds of other sites in what is called a credential stuffing attack. These attacks are automated and happen within hours of a data breach becoming public. Using a unique password for each account limits the damage of any single breach to just that one account. A password manager makes this practical by remembering all your different passwords so you only need to memorize one master password."
  - question: "What makes a password weak?"
    answer: "Several patterns make passwords easy to crack. Dictionary words (even with letter substitutions like p@ssw0rd) are vulnerable because attackers use rule-based dictionary attacks that test millions of common substitution patterns. Personal information such as names, birthdays, pet names, and addresses appear in targeted attacks. Short passwords under 8 characters can be brute-forced in minutes with modern hardware. Keyboard patterns like qwerty or 123456 appear in every attacker's wordlist. Repeated characters or simple sequences reduce entropy far below what the password length would suggest."
  - question: "Is it safe to generate passwords in a web browser?"
    answer: "Yes, as long as the generator runs entirely on the client side using JavaScript and the Web Crypto API. This tool does not send your generated password to any server. The random values come from your operating system's cryptographic random number generator, accessed through the browser's crypto.getRandomValues function. You can verify this by opening your browser's developer tools, switching to the Network tab, and confirming that no requests are made when you generate a password. If you are extra cautious, you can disconnect from the internet and the tool will continue to work normally."
  - question: "How often should I change my passwords?"
    answer: "The 2017 NIST guidelines (SP 800-63B) reversed decades of advice by recommending against mandatory periodic password changes. Forcing frequent changes tends to push people toward weaker passwords and predictable patterns (like incrementing a number at the end). Instead, change a password immediately if you suspect it has been compromised, if the service announces a breach, or if you have been sharing the password with someone who no longer needs access. Otherwise, a long and random password that is unique to that account can serve you well indefinitely."
  - question: "What is a passphrase, and is it better than a random password?"
    answer: "A passphrase is a sequence of randomly selected words, like 'correct horse battery staple' from the famous XKCD comic. Passphrases are easier to type and memorize than random character strings. A four-word passphrase drawn from a 7,776-word list (the standard Diceware list) provides about 51.7 bits of entropy, and a six-word passphrase provides about 77.5 bits. For comparison, a 12-character random password from the full ASCII pool provides about 78.6 bits. Passphrases work best for passwords you need to type manually, while random strings work well with a password manager that auto-fills them."

examples:
  - title: "Standard account password"
    scenario: "Generating a 16-character password for an online shopping account"
    inputs:
      length: 16
      uppercase: "true"
      lowercase: "true"
      numbers: "true"
      symbols: "true"
    expectedResult: "A random 16-character password like 'kR7$mN2!xQ9&pL4@' with approximately 105 bits of entropy (Very Strong)"
    explanation: "With all four character groups enabled and a length of 16, the generator draws from a pool of about 94 characters. The entropy is 16 times log2(94), which equals roughly 105 bits. This exceeds the 80-bit threshold for a strong password by a wide margin."
  - title: "PIN-style numeric code"
    scenario: "Creating a 6-digit numeric PIN for a secondary verification system"
    inputs:
      length: 6
      uppercase: "false"
      lowercase: "false"
      numbers: "true"
      symbols: "false"
    expectedResult: "A random 6-digit code like '849261' with approximately 19.9 bits of entropy (Weak - suitable only for rate-limited PIN entry)"
    explanation: "With only digits enabled, the pool is 10 characters. The entropy is 6 times log2(10), which is about 19.9 bits. This is low for a general password but acceptable for a PIN that locks out after a few failed attempts, since 1 million possible combinations cannot be brute-forced when attempts are rate-limited."
  - title: "High-security master password"
    scenario: "Generating a 24-character master password for a password manager vault"
    inputs:
      length: 24
      uppercase: "true"
      lowercase: "true"
      numbers: "true"
      symbols: "true"
    expectedResult: "A random 24-character password with approximately 157 bits of entropy (Extremely Strong)"
    explanation: "At 24 characters from the full 94-character pool, the entropy reaches about 157 bits. Even with hardware capable of one trillion guesses per second, exhausting this key space would take longer than the current age of the universe. This level of security is appropriate for a master password that protects access to all other stored credentials."
