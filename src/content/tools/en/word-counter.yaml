  title: "How Word Counting Works"
  content: "Word counting relies on detecting boundaries between words in a text string. The simplest approach splits text on whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, and line breaks) and counts the resulting segments. This tool goes further by also handling edge cases like multiple consecutive spaces, leading and trailing whitespace, and non-breaking space characters that sometimes appear in text copied from web pages or word processors. Character counting operates in two modes. 'Characters with spaces' counts every single character in the text, including spaces, punctuation, and line break characters. 'Characters without spaces' strips all whitespace before counting, giving you just the letters, digits, and punctuation marks. This distinction matters for platforms like Twitter (now X), which counts spaces toward the character limit, and for SMS messages, which also include spaces in their 160-character segments. Sentence detection works by identifying terminal punctuation marks: periods, question marks, and exclamation points. The algorithm filters out abbreviations (like 'Dr.' or 'U.S.') and decimal numbers (like '3.14') that use periods but do not mark sentence endings. Paragraph counting splits the text on double line breaks, which is the standard paragraph separator in plain text. Single line breaks within a block of text are treated as part of the same paragraph. Reading time is estimated by dividing the total word count by 225 words per minute, which is the average silent reading speed for adult English readers according to research published by Brysbaert (2019). Speaking time uses a rate of 150 words per minute, reflecting a measured and clear delivery pace for presentations and speeches. Both estimates round to the nearest minute for longer texts and show seconds for shorter pieces."
  formula: "Word Count = number of whitespace-separated tokens; Reading Time = Word Count / 225 wpm"
  formulaExplanation: "Split the input text on whitespace boundaries and count the resulting non-empty tokens to get the word count. Divide the word count by 225 for estimated reading time in minutes or by 150 for estimated speaking time in minutes."

faqs:
  - question: "How does the word counter handle hyphenated words?"
    answer: "Hyphenated words like 'well-known' or 'mother-in-law' are counted as a single word because there is no whitespace between the parts. This follows the convention used by most word processors including Microsoft Word and Google Docs. If you need each hyphenated component counted separately for a specific assignment or publication guideline, you would need to replace the hyphens with spaces before pasting your text into the tool."
  - question: "Does the character count include spaces and punctuation?"
    answer: "The tool provides two character counts. 'Characters with spaces' includes every character in your text: letters, digits, spaces, tabs, punctuation marks, and special characters. 'Characters without spaces' excludes all whitespace but still counts punctuation and special characters. This dual count is helpful because different platforms and style guides define character limits differently. Twitter counts spaces, but some SMS systems and headline guidelines do not."
  - question: "How accurate is the reading time estimate?"
    answer: "The reading time uses 225 words per minute as the baseline, which comes from a 2019 meta-analysis of 190 studies on English reading rates. Individual reading speed varies widely based on the complexity of the material, the reader's familiarity with the topic, and whether they are skimming or reading closely. Technical or academic text is typically read at 150-200 words per minute, while light fiction might be read at 250-300 words per minute. Treat the estimate as a reasonable midpoint for general-audience content."
  - question: "Can I use this tool for languages other than English?"
    answer: "The word counter works with any language that uses spaces to separate words, including Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, and most other European languages. For languages like Chinese, Japanese, and Thai that do not use spaces between words, the tool will not produce an accurate word count because it relies on whitespace as a word boundary. Character counting, however, works accurately for all languages since it simply counts individual characters regardless of language."
  - question: "What counts as a sentence in this tool?"
    answer: "A sentence is defined as a text segment ending with a period, question mark, or exclamation point. The algorithm tries to exclude false positives like abbreviations (Mr., Dr., etc.), initials, and decimal numbers that use periods. However, unconventional formatting or heavy use of ellipses (...) may cause the sentence count to differ slightly from a manual count. For most standard prose, the sentence detection is reliable and matches what a human reader would identify as sentence boundaries."
  - question: "How are paragraphs detected in the text?"
    answer: "The tool counts paragraphs by looking for double line breaks (a blank line between blocks of text). This is the standard paragraph separator in plain text, email, and most text editors. A single line break without a blank line between text blocks does not start a new paragraph. If your text uses single line breaks to separate paragraphs (as some messaging apps do), the count may be lower than expected. Adding a blank line between each paragraph will give you an accurate count."
  - question: "Does the word counter work with pasted text from PDFs or websites?"
    answer: "Yes, you can paste text from any source. However, text copied from PDFs sometimes carries hidden characters, extra line breaks, or non-standard spacing that can affect the counts slightly. Web pages may include non-breaking spaces or zero-width characters that are invisible but still count toward the character total. If your counts look unexpected after pasting, try running the text through a plain text editor first to strip out hidden formatting characters."
  - question: "What is the difference between word count and keyword density?"
    answer: "Word count is simply the total number of words in your text. Keyword density is a ratio that measures how often a specific word or phrase appears relative to the total word count, usually expressed as a percentage. For example, if your text has 500 words and the phrase 'word counter' appears 5 times (10 words), its keyword density is 2%. SEO professionals use keyword density as one of many signals for content optimization, though modern search engines weigh context and relevance far more than raw keyword frequency."

examples:
  - title: "Short blog post"
    scenario: "A writer pastes a 450-word blog post and wants to check if it meets a 500-word minimum"
    inputs:
      text: "A 450-word blog post about productivity tips..."
      wordCount: 450
    expectedResult: "450 words, ~2,500 characters, ~25 sentences, ~6 paragraphs, ~2 min reading time"
    explanation: "At 450 words, the post falls 50 words short of the 500-word target. The reading time estimate of roughly 2 minutes (450 divided by 225 wpm) suggests a quick read. The writer can see exactly how many more words to add to meet the minimum requirement."
  - title: "Academic essay with a character limit"
    scenario: "A student has written a 2,000-character personal statement for a college application that allows a maximum of 2,500 characters including spaces"
    inputs:
      text: "A personal statement about career goals and academic interests..."
      characterCount: 2000
    expectedResult: "~350 words, 2,000 characters (with spaces), ~1,650 characters (without spaces), ~1 min reading time"
    explanation: "The student has used 2,000 of the allowed 2,500 characters including spaces. This leaves 500 characters of room to expand on a point or add another sentence. The word count of roughly 350 words translates to about one and a half minutes of reading time."
  - title: "Conference presentation script"
    scenario: "A speaker prepares a script and needs to fit within a 10-minute time slot at 150 words per minute"
    inputs:
      text: "A prepared speech about renewable energy trends..."
      wordCount: 1500
    expectedResult: "1,500 words, ~8,500 characters, ~75 sentences, ~15 paragraphs, ~7 min reading time, ~10 min speaking time"
    explanation: "At 1,500 words and a speaking rate of 150 words per minute, the speech fits perfectly into a 10-minute slot. The reading time is shorter at about 7 minutes because silent reading (225 wpm) is faster than spoken delivery. The speaker has hit the target length without going over."
