intro: "Compound interest is what turns small, consistent investing into serious wealth over time. Albert Einstein may or may not have called it the eighth wonder of the world, but the math speaks for itself. This calculator shows you exactly how your initial investment grows when returns are reinvested and start generating their own returns. Enter your starting amount, interest rate, time horizon, and compounding frequency to see the snowball effect in action."

  title: "How Compound Interest Works"
  content: "Compound interest calculates interest not just on your original principal, but also on all previously accumulated interest. This creates exponential growth rather than linear growth. The formula multiplies your principal by one plus the periodic interest rate raised to the power of the total number of compounding periods. Consider a practical example: if you invest $10,000 at 7% annual interest compounded monthly for 30 years, the result is $81,164.97. With simple interest, the same investment would only reach $31,000. That difference of over $50,000 comes entirely from the compounding effect, where interest earned in previous periods itself earns interest going forward. Compounding frequency matters more than most people realize. The same $10,000 at 7% for 30 years produces $76,122.55 with annual compounding, $79,941.55 with quarterly compounding, and $81,164.97 with monthly compounding. Daily compounding pushes it slightly higher to $81,588.15. The gap between annual and monthly compounding is significant, but the difference between monthly and daily is relatively small. Time is the most powerful variable in this equation. Doubling the time period more than doubles the result because of exponential growth. The Rule of 72 provides a quick approximation: divide 72 by the annual interest rate to estimate how many years it takes to double your money. At 7%, your investment roughly doubles every 10.3 years. This is why starting to invest early, even with small amounts, produces dramatically better outcomes than starting later with larger amounts."

faqs:
  - question: "What is the difference between simple and compound interest?"
    answer: "Simple interest is calculated only on the original principal amount, producing linear growth. Compound interest calculates interest on both the principal and all previously earned interest, creating exponential growth. On a $10,000 investment at 5% for 20 years, simple interest earns $10,000 total (returning $20,000), while compound interest earns approximately $16,533 (returning $26,533). The longer the time period, the more dramatic the difference becomes."
  - question: "How often should interest be compounded?"
    answer: "More frequent compounding produces slightly higher returns. Monthly compounding is the most common for savings accounts and investments. The difference between monthly and daily compounding is minimal in practice. For a $10,000 investment at 5% over 10 years: annual compounding yields $16,288.95, monthly yields $16,470.09, and daily yields $16,486.65. The jump from annual to monthly is meaningful, but monthly to daily adds less than $17 over a decade."
  - question: "What is the Rule of 72?"
    answer: "The Rule of 72 is a quick mental math shortcut to estimate how long it takes an investment to double in value with compound interest. Divide 72 by the annual interest rate to get the approximate doubling time in years. At 6% interest, your money doubles in roughly 12 years (72/6). At 8%, it doubles in about 9 years. At 12%, roughly 6 years. This approximation works best for rates between 4% and 12% and becomes less accurate at extreme rates."
  - question: "Does compound interest work against me with debt?"
    answer: "Compound interest works identically with debt, but in reverse. Credit card balances, for example, compound daily on unpaid amounts. A $5,000 credit card balance at 22% APR compounded daily, if left unpaid, grows to roughly $6,160 after one year and over $14,800 after five years. This is why paying only minimum payments on credit cards is so costly and why high-interest debt should be prioritized for repayment."
  - question: "What realistic rate of return should I expect?"
    answer: "Historical stock market returns (S&P 500) have averaged roughly 10% annually before inflation and about 7% after inflation over the long term. High-yield savings accounts currently offer 4% to 5%. Government bonds historically return 2% to 4%. Real estate appreciation averages 3% to 5% annually. When planning long-term, using 6% to 7% for a diversified investment portfolio provides a reasonable after-inflation projection."
  - question: "How does inflation affect compound interest growth?"
    answer: "Inflation reduces the purchasing power of your future returns. If your investment earns 7% annually but inflation averages 3%, your real (inflation-adjusted) return is approximately 4%. On $10,000 over 30 years at 7% nominal return, you would have $76,123 in nominal terms, but only about $32,434 in current purchasing power. Always consider both nominal and real returns when evaluating long-term investment projections."

examples:
  - title: "Long-term stock market investment"
    scenario: "Investing $10,000 at 7% compounded monthly for 30 years"
    inputs:
      principal: 10000
      annualRate: 7
      years: 30
      compounding: "monthly"
    expectedResult: "Future value: $81,164.97 | Interest earned: $71,164.97"
    explanation: "Your $10,000 grows more than 8x over 30 years. The majority of the growth happens in the later years due to exponential compounding. After 10 years you have $20,097, after 20 years $40,387, and the final decade alone adds over $40,000."
  - title: "High-yield savings account"
    scenario: "Depositing $5,000 at 4.5% compounded daily for 5 years"
    inputs:
      principal: 5000
      annualRate: 4.5
      years: 5
      compounding: "daily"
    expectedResult: "Future value: $6,261.61 | Interest earned: $1,261.61"
    explanation: "A high-yield savings account provides modest but safe growth. The $1,262 in interest comes with FDIC insurance protection and no market risk, making this suitable for emergency funds or short-term savings goals."
  - title: "Effect of compounding frequency"
    scenario: "Comparing $20,000 at 6% for 20 years with annual vs. monthly compounding"
    inputs:
      principal: 20000
      annualRate: 6
      years: 20
      compounding: "annual"
    expectedResult: "Annual: $64,142.71 | Monthly: $66,132.03"
    explanation: "Monthly compounding produces $1,989 more than annual compounding over 20 years on the same principal and rate. While the percentage difference is small (about 3%), it represents free money simply from more frequent compounding."
