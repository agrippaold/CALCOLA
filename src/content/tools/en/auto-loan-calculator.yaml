intro: "Purchasing a vehicle is one of the largest expenses most people face after housing. Before you step onto the dealer lot, knowing your monthly payment and total loan cost puts you in a much stronger negotiating position. This auto loan calculator factors in the vehicle price, your down payment, any trade-in value, the interest rate, and the loan term to show you exactly what you will pay each month and how much interest accumulates over the life of the loan. Use it to compare different scenarios and find a financing plan that fits your budget."

  title: "How Auto Loan Payments Work"
  content: "Auto loans are standard installment loans that use fixed-rate amortization to determine your monthly payment. The lender takes the net amount financed, which is the vehicle price minus your down payment and any trade-in credit, then applies the interest rate over the chosen loan term. Each monthly payment remains constant, but the split between principal and interest changes over time. Early payments carry a heavier interest portion because the outstanding balance is at its highest. As the principal decreases, less interest accrues each month, and a larger share of each payment reduces the actual loan balance. The down payment and trade-in value both reduce the amount you need to finance, which directly lowers both your monthly payment and the total interest you pay. Putting 20% down on a vehicle purchase is a common recommendation because it offsets the rapid depreciation new cars experience in their first few years. A new car typically loses 20% to 30% of its value in the first year alone, so a smaller down payment can leave you owing more than the car is worth, a situation known as being upside down or underwater on the loan. Loan term length creates a significant tradeoff. A shorter term, such as 36 or 48 months, means higher monthly payments but substantially less total interest. A longer term of 60, 72, or even 84 months lowers the monthly payment but increases the total interest cost and keeps you in debt longer. On a $30,000 loan at 6%, choosing 72 months instead of 48 months lowers the payment by about $120 but adds approximately $2,800 in total interest. New car loan rates are generally lower than used car rates because lenders consider new vehicles less risky collateral. As of recent data, average new car rates range from about 5% to 7% for borrowers with good credit, while used car rates run about 1 to 2 percentage points higher. Your credit score is the single biggest factor in the rate you receive. Scores above 720 typically qualify for the most competitive rates, while scores below 600 may face rates of 12% or higher. Improving your credit before applying, or getting pre-approved through your bank or credit union before visiting the dealership, often results in better financing terms."
  formula: "M = (P - D - T) x [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]"
  formulaExplanation: "M = monthly payment, P = vehicle price, D = down payment, T = trade-in value, r = monthly interest rate (annual rate / 12 / 100), n = total number of payments (years x 12)"

faqs:
  - question: "How much should I put down on a car?"
    answer: "Financial advisors generally recommend a down payment of at least 20% for new cars and 10% for used cars. A larger down payment reduces the amount financed, lowers your monthly payment, and decreases total interest. It also protects you from being underwater on the loan, which happens when you owe more than the vehicle is worth. If you cannot reach 20%, aim for at least enough to cover taxes, fees, and the first year of depreciation."
  - question: "Are interest rates lower for new cars than used cars?"
    answer: "Yes, new car loan rates are typically 1 to 2 percentage points lower than used car rates. Lenders view new vehicles as more reliable collateral with longer expected useful life. Manufacturers also frequently offer promotional financing rates, sometimes as low as 0% or 1.9% APR, on select new models. Used car rates are higher to account for the greater risk of mechanical issues and faster remaining depreciation. Shopping among multiple lenders still matters, as rates vary significantly."
  - question: "What loan term should I choose for a car?"
    answer: "Most financial experts suggest keeping your auto loan term at 48 to 60 months. Shorter terms like 36 months mean higher payments but less total interest and faster equity building. Terms beyond 60 months lower the monthly payment but significantly increase total interest and keep you making payments on a depreciating asset for longer. A 72-month or 84-month loan might seem attractive for the lower payment, but you risk owing more than the car is worth for years into the loan."
  - question: "What is gap insurance and do I need it?"
    answer: "Gap insurance covers the difference between what you owe on your auto loan and the car's actual cash value if the vehicle is totaled or stolen. Standard auto insurance only pays the current market value, which may be less than your loan balance, especially in the first couple of years. Gap insurance is strongly recommended if you made a down payment of less than 20%, financed for more than 60 months, or purchased a vehicle that depreciates quickly. It typically costs $20 to $40 per year when added to your auto insurance policy."
  - question: "Can I refinance my auto loan to get a better rate?"
    answer: "Yes, refinancing an auto loan is straightforward and can save you money if rates have dropped since your original loan or if your credit score has improved. Most lenders allow refinancing of vehicles that are less than seven years old with fewer than 100,000 miles. To refinance, gather quotes from banks, credit unions, and online lenders, then compare the new monthly payment and total remaining interest against your current loan. Be aware of any prepayment penalties on your existing loan and factor in any refinancing fees."
  - question: "Should I finance through the dealership or my own bank?"
    answer: "Getting pre-approved through your bank or credit union before visiting the dealership gives you a baseline rate to compare against dealer financing offers. Dealerships often mark up the interest rate by 1 to 2 percentage points as additional profit. However, manufacturers sometimes offer promotional rates through dealer financing that are lower than anything a bank can provide. The best approach is to arrive pre-approved, then ask the dealer if they can beat your rate. This creates healthy competition and ensures you get the best available terms."

examples:
  - title: "New car purchase"
    scenario: "Buying a $35,000 new car with $5,000 down and no trade-in at 5.9% for 5 years"
    inputs:
      vehiclePrice: 35000
      downPayment: 5000
      tradeIn: 0
      interestRate: 5.9
      loanTerm: 5
    expectedResult: "Monthly payment: $578.59 | Total interest: $4,715.41"
    explanation: "The net amount financed is $30,000. Over 60 monthly payments of $578.59, you pay a total of $34,715.41, meaning $4,715.41 goes to interest. A larger down payment of $7,000 instead of $5,000 would reduce total interest by roughly $314 and lower the monthly payment by about $39."
  - title: "Used car with trade-in"
    scenario: "Buying a $22,000 used car with $2,000 down and $5,000 trade-in at 7.5% for 4 years"
    inputs:
      vehiclePrice: 22000
      downPayment: 2000
      tradeIn: 5000
      interestRate: 7.5
      loanTerm: 4
    expectedResult: "Monthly payment: $362.68 | Total interest: $2,408.81"
    explanation: "The trade-in and down payment together reduce the financed amount to $15,000. Over 48 months, the total cost is $17,408.81, with $2,408.81 in interest charges. The trade-in saved approximately $805 in interest compared to financing the full $20,000 difference after the down payment."
  - title: "Extended term financing"
    scenario: "Financing a $28,000 car with $3,000 down and no trade-in at 6.5% for 6 years"
    inputs:
      vehiclePrice: 28000
      downPayment: 3000
      tradeIn: 0
      interestRate: 6.5
      loanTerm: 6
    expectedResult: "Monthly payment: $420.25 | Total interest: $5,257.87"
    explanation: "The 72-month term keeps the monthly payment at $420.25, but the total interest reaches $5,257.87. Choosing a 48-month term instead would raise the monthly payment to approximately $592 but cut total interest to roughly $3,430, saving about $1,828 over the life of the loan."
