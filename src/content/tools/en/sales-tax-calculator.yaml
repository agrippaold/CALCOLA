intro: "Sales tax rates change from state to state, county to county, and even city to city, which makes it surprisingly hard to know the exact total before you reach the register. This sales tax calculator lets you enter a price and a tax rate to instantly see the tax amount and the final price you will pay. Use it to budget for large purchases, compare after-tax costs between jurisdictions, or verify that the amount on your receipt is correct."

  title: "How Sales Tax Is Calculated"
  content: "Sales tax in the United States is a consumption tax imposed at the point of sale on goods and certain services. Unlike value-added tax systems used in Europe and much of the world, US sales tax is calculated only once, at the final retail transaction, rather than at each stage of production and distribution. The calculation is straightforward: multiply the pre-tax price by the tax rate to find the tax amount, then add it to the original price for the total. A $49.99 item at an 8.25% sales tax rate incurs $4.12 in tax (49.99 times 0.0825 equals 4.124175, rounded to $4.12), making the total $54.11. What makes US sales tax complex is the layered structure. There is no federal sales tax. Instead, 45 states and the District of Columbia impose their own state-level sales tax, with rates ranging from 2.9% in Colorado to 7.25% in California. On top of the state rate, counties and cities can add their own local taxes. This means the combined rate in one neighborhood can differ from the rate just a few miles away. For example, the combined rate in Chicago, Illinois is 10.25%, while nearby suburbs may charge only 7% or 8%. The highest combined rates in the country exceed 10% in parts of Louisiana, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Alabama. Five states, Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon, have no statewide sales tax, though some cities in Alaska do levy local sales taxes. Many states exempt certain categories of goods from sales tax entirely. Groceries are exempt or taxed at a reduced rate in most states, while clothing is exempt in states like Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York (for items under $110). Prescription medications are exempt in nearly every state. Some states hold sales tax holidays, usually in late summer before the school year, during which qualifying items like clothing, school supplies, and computers can be purchased tax-free up to certain price limits. Use tax is a related concept that many consumers overlook. When you buy something from an out-of-state seller who does not collect your state's sales tax, you are technically required to report and pay use tax directly to your state. This applies to many online purchases, though the 2018 Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair now allows states to require large online retailers to collect sales tax regardless of physical presence. When budgeting for a purchase, always look up the combined state and local rate for the specific location where you are buying. A few percentage points of difference may not matter on a $10 item, but on a $2,000 appliance, the gap between a 6% rate and a 10% rate amounts to $80 in extra tax."

faqs:
  - question: "Which US states have no sales tax?"
    answer: "Five states have no statewide sales tax: Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon. However, Alaska allows local municipalities to impose their own sales taxes, so some cities in Alaska do charge sales tax at rates up to about 7.5%. Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon have no sales tax at any level. If you live near a state border, shopping in a tax-free state can yield noticeable savings on large purchases."
  - question: "Is sales tax calculated on the original price or the discounted price?"
    answer: "Sales tax is calculated on the actual amount you pay after all discounts, coupons, and markdowns have been applied. If a $100 item is on sale for $75, you pay tax on $75, not on the original $100. This applies to store discounts, manufacturer coupons, and promotional pricing. The only exception in some states involves manufacturer rebates processed after the sale, where tax may be charged on the pre-rebate price."
  - question: "Why does the tax rate vary so much between cities and states?"
    answer: "The variation exists because sales tax in the US is set independently by state, county, and city governments, each of which has its own budget needs and tax policies. States with no income tax, like Texas, Tennessee, and Washington, tend to rely more heavily on sales tax revenue and therefore set higher rates. Local jurisdictions add their own surcharges to fund schools, transit systems, stadiums, and other projects. This layered approach means the combined rate reflects decisions made by multiple levels of government."
  - question: "Are groceries taxed the same as other items?"
    answer: "Most states either exempt groceries from sales tax entirely or tax them at a reduced rate. For example, in Texas and New York, unprepared food for home consumption is exempt from sales tax. In states like Virginia and Illinois, groceries are taxed at a lower rate than general merchandise. However, some states, including Alabama, Mississippi, and South Dakota, tax groceries at the full sales tax rate. Prepared food, like deli items, restaurant meals, and hot foods, is almost always taxed at the regular rate."
  - question: "What is use tax and do I have to pay it?"
    answer: "Use tax applies when you purchase an item from a seller who did not collect sales tax on the transaction, most commonly with out-of-state or online purchases. The use tax rate is typically the same as your local sales tax rate. Technically, you are required to report and pay this tax on your state income tax return. Since the Wayfair ruling in 2018, most large online retailers now collect sales tax automatically, which has reduced the practical impact of use tax for everyday consumers, though it still applies to private sales and small sellers."
  - question: "What are sales tax holidays and how do they work?"
    answer: "Sales tax holidays are temporary periods, usually lasting one to three days, when a state suspends sales tax on specific categories of goods. Most commonly, they occur in late July or August and cover back-to-school items like clothing, footwear, school supplies, and sometimes computers or tablets. Each state sets its own rules, including price caps for qualifying items. For example, a state may exempt clothing priced under $100 per item but still tax items above that threshold. Around 20 states offer some form of sales tax holiday each year."

examples:
  - title: "Electronics purchase at 8.25% rate"
    scenario: "Buying a $49.99 gadget in a city with an 8.25% combined sales tax rate"
    inputs:
      price: 49.99
      taxRate: 8.25
    expectedResult: "Tax: $4.12 | Total: $54.11"
    explanation: "The tax is $49.99 times 0.0825, which equals $4.124175, rounded down to $4.12. Adding the tax to the price gives a total of $54.11. This combined rate is typical for many cities in Texas, where the state rate of 6.25% is supplemented by local taxes up to 2%."
  - title: "Multi-item shopping trip at 6% rate"
    scenario: "Purchasing $235.50 worth of goods in a state with a 6% sales tax rate"
    inputs:
      price: 235.50
      taxRate: 6.0
    expectedResult: "Tax: $14.13 | Total: $249.63"
    explanation: "At 6%, the tax on $235.50 is $14.13 (235.50 times 0.06). The total comes to $249.63. A 6% rate is common in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Kentucky. For a shopping trip of this size, the tax adds a meaningful amount to the total cost."
  - title: "High-tax state purchase at 10.25%"
    scenario: "Buying a $150.00 item in Chicago with a 10.25% combined rate"
    inputs:
      price: 150.00
      taxRate: 10.25
    expectedResult: "Tax: $15.38 | Total: $165.38"
    explanation: "Chicago has one of the highest combined sales tax rates in the country at 10.25%. On a $150.00 purchase, the tax is $15.38 (150 times 0.1025 equals 15.375, rounded to $15.38). Compared to a state with no sales tax, the difference is significant. On larger purchases, some consumers drive to nearby lower-tax jurisdictions to save money."
