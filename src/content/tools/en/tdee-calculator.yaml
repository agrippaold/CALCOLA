intro: "Your TDEE represents the total number of calories you burn in a full day, including everything from breathing to exercising to walking around your house. It combines your Basal Metabolic Rate with the energy cost of all physical activity. Whether you want to lose fat, build muscle, or maintain your current physique, TDEE is the number you need to plan your diet around. This calculator gives you a reliable estimate based on the Mifflin-St Jeor BMR equation and validated activity multipliers."

  title: "How TDEE Is Calculated"
  content: "TDEE is calculated by first determining your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation, then multiplying it by an activity factor that reflects your typical daily movement and exercise habits. The activity multipliers used in this calculator come from research on energy expenditure across different lifestyle patterns. Sedentary individuals (desk job, minimal exercise) multiply BMR by 1.2, meaning physical activity adds about 20% to baseline energy needs. Lightly active people (casual exercise 1-3 days per week) use 1.375. Moderately active (structured exercise 3-5 days per week) use 1.55. Active individuals (intense exercise 6-7 days per week) use 1.725. Very active people (athletes, physical labor jobs) use 1.9. These multipliers account for both structured exercise and Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT), which includes all movement outside of intentional workouts. NEAT varies enormously between individuals and can account for 200 to 900 calories per day depending on occupation, fidgeting habits, and general lifestyle. A warehouse worker who also exercises has much higher NEAT than an office worker who goes to the gym for the same duration. The thermic effect of food (TEF) is also built into these multipliers. Your body spends roughly 10% of total calorie intake on digesting and processing food. Protein has the highest thermic effect at 20% to 30% of its calories, followed by carbohydrates at 5% to 10%, and fats at 0% to 3%. This is one reason high-protein diets effectively support fat loss. Keep in mind that TDEE is an estimate, not a precise measurement. Individual variation in metabolic efficiency, hormone levels, gut microbiome composition, and daily activity fluctuations mean your actual expenditure on any given day may differ by 10% to 15% from the calculated value. Use TDEE as a starting point and adjust based on real-world results over 2 to 4 weeks."
  formula: "TDEE = BMR × Activity Multiplier"
  formulaExplanation: "BMR is calculated using Mifflin-St Jeor (10×weight + 6.25×height - 5×age ± gender constant). Activity multipliers range from 1.2 (sedentary) to 1.9 (very active)."

faqs:
  - question: "What activity level should I select?"
    answer: "Be honest about your average week rather than choosing your most active week. Sedentary means you have a desk job and do not exercise regularly. Light activity covers casual walking, yoga, or light exercise 1-3 times per week. Moderate fits most regular gym-goers who train 3-5 times per week with moderate intensity. Active applies if you exercise intensely most days. Very active is reserved for competitive athletes, construction workers, or those combining a physical job with regular training. When in doubt, choose one level lower than you think and adjust based on results."
  - question: "How do I use TDEE for weight loss?"
    answer: "To lose weight, eat fewer calories than your TDEE. A deficit of 500 calories per day produces approximately 0.45 kg (1 lb) of fat loss per week. Start by subtracting 300-500 calories from your TDEE and monitor your weight over 2-3 weeks. If you are not losing weight, reduce by another 100-200 calories. Avoid deficits larger than 1,000 calories per day as they increase muscle loss, reduce energy levels, and are difficult to sustain. Pair your calorie deficit with adequate protein intake (1.6-2.2 g per kg body weight) to preserve muscle mass."
  - question: "How do I use TDEE for muscle gain?"
    answer: "Building muscle requires eating above your TDEE to provide energy and nutrients for new tissue synthesis. A surplus of 200-400 calories per day supports muscle growth while minimizing fat gain. This typically produces weight gain of 0.25-0.5 kg per week. Protein needs are highest during a surplus: aim for 1.6-2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight daily. Track your waist measurement alongside body weight to ensure gains are primarily lean mass rather than fat."
  - question: "Why is my TDEE different from my fitness tracker estimate?"
    answer: "Fitness trackers estimate TDEE using heart rate data, step counts, and accelerometer readings, while this calculator uses a formula-based approach. Both are estimates with margins of error. Fitness trackers tend to overestimate calorie burn during exercise by 27% to 93% according to Stanford University research. The formula approach can underestimate TDEE for very active individuals. For the most accurate picture, average your tracker estimate with the formula estimate, or simply use the calculator value as a starting point and adjust based on real weight changes over 2-3 weeks."
  - question: "Does TDEE change over time?"
    answer: "TDEE changes with shifts in body weight, body composition, age, and activity patterns. Losing weight reduces TDEE because a smaller body requires less energy to maintain. Gaining muscle increases TDEE because muscle tissue is metabolically active. Metabolic adaptation during extended calorie restriction can temporarily lower TDEE beyond what the formula predicts. Recalculate your TDEE whenever your weight changes by more than 5 kg or your activity level shifts significantly."
  - question: "What is NEAT and why does it matter for TDEE?"
    answer: "Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT) includes all physical activity that is not structured exercise: walking to the store, fidgeting, standing at your desk, cooking, cleaning, and general daily movement. NEAT can account for 200 to 900 calories per day and explains much of the variation in total calorie burn between people with similar exercise habits. Individuals who unconsciously move more throughout the day often maintain lower body fat despite similar dietary patterns. Increasing NEAT through walking meetings, standing desks, or parking farther away can meaningfully boost daily expenditure."

examples:
  - title: "Moderately active male"
    scenario: "A 30-year-old male, 80 kg, 180 cm, moderate exercise 3-5 days/week"
    inputs:
      weight: 80
      height: 180
      age: 30
      gender: "male"
      activity: "moderate"
    expectedResult: "TDEE: 2,759 kcal/day | BMR: 1,780 kcal"
    explanation: "His BMR of 1,780 is multiplied by 1.55 for moderate activity. To lose weight, he would target approximately 2,259 calories per day (500 deficit). To gain muscle, approximately 3,059 calories (300 surplus)."
  - title: "Sedentary female office worker"
    scenario: "A 35-year-old female, 65 kg, 162 cm, desk job with no regular exercise"
    inputs:
      weight: 65
      height: 162
      age: 35
      gender: "female"
      activity: "sedentary"
    expectedResult: "TDEE: 1,618 kcal/day | BMR: 1,348 kcal"
    explanation: "With a sedentary lifestyle, her daily needs are only about 1,618 calories. Adding light exercise 3 times per week would increase TDEE to approximately 1,854 calories, giving her more dietary flexibility while maintaining or losing weight."
  - title: "Very active athlete"
    scenario: "A 25-year-old male, 85 kg, 185 cm, training twice daily"
    inputs:
      weight: 85
      height: 185
      age: 25
      gender: "male"
      activity: "very_active"
    expectedResult: "TDEE: 3,548 kcal/day | BMR: 1,868 kcal"
    explanation: "This athlete needs over 3,500 calories daily to maintain his current weight and training load. Eating below 3,000 calories would likely cause performance decline, fatigue, and gradual weight loss."
