intro: "Value Added Tax is applied to goods and services in over 160 countries, and calculating it correctly matters whether you are pricing products, filing tax returns, or checking a receipt. This VAT calculator works in two directions: add VAT to a net price to find the gross amount, or extract VAT from a gross price to reveal the net amount and the tax portion. Enter any VAT rate to handle UK, EU, or any other country's tax system."

  title: "How VAT Calculations Work"
  content: "Value Added Tax, commonly known as VAT, is a consumption tax applied at each stage of the supply chain where value is added. Unlike US sales tax, which is collected only at the final point of sale, VAT is charged every time a product or service changes hands, from raw materials to manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer. Each business in the chain charges VAT on its sales and reclaims the VAT it paid on its purchases, so the tax burden ultimately falls on the end consumer. This mechanism is sometimes called a multi-stage tax. Adding VAT to a net price is straightforward multiplication. If the net price is $100 and the VAT rate is 20%, the VAT amount is $100 times 0.20, which equals $20. The gross (VAT-inclusive) price is $100 plus $20, giving $120. The formula is: Gross = Net x (1 + VAT Rate / 100). Extracting VAT from a gross price requires dividing rather than subtracting. To find the net price from a $120 gross amount at 20% VAT, divide $120 by 1.20, which gives $100 net. The VAT portion is $120 minus $100, equaling $20. A common mistake is to simply calculate 20% of $120 ($24), which overstates the VAT because the gross price already includes the tax. The correct extraction formula is: VAT Amount = Gross - (Gross / (1 + VAT Rate / 100)). VAT rates differ substantially across countries. The United Kingdom applies a standard rate of 20%, a reduced rate of 5% for items like home energy and child car seats, and a zero rate for essentials like most food, children's clothing, and books. Germany uses 19% standard and 7% reduced. France charges 20% standard with reduced rates of 10%, 5.5%, and 2.1% for various categories. Some EU countries have rates as high as 27% (Hungary) or as low as 17% (Luxembourg). For businesses registered for VAT, the ability to reclaim input VAT is a central feature of the system. If a retailer buys inventory for $1,000 plus $200 VAT and sells it for $1,500 plus $300 VAT, the retailer remits only the $100 difference ($300 collected minus $200 already paid) to the tax authority. This self-policing mechanism is one reason VAT is favored by governments worldwide, it creates a paper trail at every transaction. Understanding whether a quoted price includes or excludes VAT is important when comparing costs. In the UK and most EU countries, consumer-facing prices must include VAT by law, so the price on the shelf is what you pay. In business-to-business transactions, prices are often quoted excluding VAT because the buyer can reclaim it. When shopping across borders within the EU, VAT rules depend on whether the buyer is a registered business or a private consumer, and whether the seller exceeds distance-selling thresholds in the buyer's country."

faqs:
  - question: "What is the difference between VAT and sales tax?"
    answer: "VAT is collected at every stage of production and distribution, with each business paying VAT on its purchases and charging VAT on its sales, then remitting the difference to the government. Sales tax is collected only once, at the final retail sale to the consumer. The result for the end consumer is similar, you pay a percentage on top of the price, but the collection mechanism and compliance burden are different. VAT creates a self-enforcing audit trail because each buyer and seller reports the same transactions."
  - question: "How do I extract VAT from a price that already includes it?"
    answer: "To extract VAT from a gross (tax-inclusive) price, divide the gross amount by 1 plus the VAT rate as a decimal. For a UK price of $240 including 20% VAT, divide $240 by 1.20 to get a net price of $200. The VAT amount is $240 minus $200, which equals $40. Do not simply take 20% of $240 ($48), as that would overstate the tax. The gross price already has VAT baked in, so you must divide it out rather than subtract a percentage."
  - question: "What are the standard VAT rates in major European countries?"
    answer: "As of 2025, standard VAT rates across major EU countries are: Germany 19%, France 20%, Italy 22%, Spain 21%, Netherlands 21%, Belgium 21%, Austria 20%, Sweden 25%, Denmark 25%, and Poland 23%. The United Kingdom, no longer in the EU, maintains a 20% standard rate. Hungary has the highest rate in the EU at 27%, while Luxembourg has the lowest at 17%. Most countries also apply reduced rates to categories like food, medicine, and public transport."
  - question: "Can businesses reclaim VAT on their purchases?"
    answer: "Yes, VAT-registered businesses can reclaim the VAT they pay on business-related purchases, known as input VAT. They do this by subtracting their input VAT from the output VAT they collect on sales, then paying only the net difference to the tax authority. If input VAT exceeds output VAT in a given period, the business can claim a refund. There are restrictions on what qualifies, for example, VAT on business entertainment and some vehicle costs is often not reclaimable depending on the country's specific rules."
  - question: "What items are zero-rated or exempt from VAT in the UK?"
    answer: "In the UK, zero-rated items include most food and drink (excluding restaurant meals, alcohol, and confectionery), children's clothing and footwear, books and newspapers, public transport, and new residential construction. Exempt items, which differ from zero-rated in that businesses cannot reclaim input VAT on them, include financial services, insurance, education, and healthcare. The reduced 5% rate applies to domestic fuel and power, children's car seats, and certain energy-saving home improvements."
  - question: "Do I pay VAT when buying from another EU country?"
    answer: "For consumers making personal purchases, VAT is generally included in the price at the seller's country rate for orders below the distance-selling threshold. Once a seller exceeds the threshold in a particular country, they must register and charge VAT at the buyer's country rate. For VAT-registered businesses buying from another EU country, the reverse charge mechanism applies: the buyer accounts for VAT in their own country instead of the seller charging it. This system prevents businesses from needing to register for VAT in every EU member state."

examples:
  - title: "Adding 20% UK VAT to a product"
    scenario: "A business sells a product for a net price of $100.00 and needs to add 20% UK VAT"
    inputs:
      netPrice: 100.00
      vatRate: 20
      mode: "add"
    expectedResult: "VAT: $20.00 | Gross price: $120.00"
    explanation: "The VAT is $100.00 times 0.20, which equals $20.00. Adding this to the net price gives a gross (VAT-inclusive) price of $120.00. This is the standard calculation for UK businesses pricing their products for consumer sale, where the shelf price must include VAT."
  - title: "Extracting VAT from a gross receipt"
    scenario: "A receipt shows a total of $120.00 and you need to find out how much of that is 20% VAT"
    inputs:
      grossPrice: 120.00
      vatRate: 20
      mode: "extract"
    expectedResult: "Net price: $100.00 | VAT: $20.00"
    explanation: "To extract VAT, divide $120.00 by 1.20 (that is, 1 plus the VAT rate as a decimal). This gives a net price of $100.00. The VAT portion is $120.00 minus $100.00, equaling $20.00. Note that simply calculating 20% of $120 would incorrectly give $24, because the VAT is a fraction of the gross, not a simple percentage of it."
  - title: "EU reduced rate on essential goods"
    scenario: "A children's car seat is priced at $75.00 net with a 5% reduced VAT rate"
    inputs:
      netPrice: 75.00
      vatRate: 5
      mode: "add"
    expectedResult: "VAT: $3.75 | Gross price: $78.75"
    explanation: "At the reduced 5% rate, the VAT on $75.00 is $3.75, bringing the total to $78.75. Reduced VAT rates are applied to goods and services considered essential or socially beneficial, such as children's safety products, home energy, and certain medical devices."
