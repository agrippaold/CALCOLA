intro: "Body fat percentage tells you far more about your health and fitness than your weight or BMI ever could. Two people at the same height and weight can look completely different depending on how much of their mass is fat versus muscle. This calculator uses the US Navy circumference method to estimate your body fat percentage from a few simple tape measurements. You will also see your fat mass, lean mass, and how your result compares to healthy ranges for your age and gender."

  title: "How the US Navy Body Fat Method Works"
  content: "The US Navy body fat estimation method was developed by Hodgdon and Beckett at the Naval Health Research Center in 1984. It uses circumference measurements taken at specific body sites combined with height to predict body fat percentage through a logarithmic equation. For males, the formula requires three measurements: waist circumference at the navel, neck circumference just below the larynx, and height. The equation is: Body Fat Percentage = 86.010 times log10 of (waist minus neck) minus 70.041 times log10 of (height) plus 36.76. For females, the formula adds a hip circumference measurement: Body Fat Percentage = 163.205 times log10 of (waist plus hip minus neck) minus 97.684 times log10 of (height) minus 78.387. All measurements should be taken in centimeters for the metric version. The logarithmic nature of the formula accounts for the nonlinear relationship between circumference measurements and actual fat distribution. Why these specific body sites? Waist circumference correlates strongly with visceral fat storage, the type of fat surrounding internal organs that drives metabolic disease risk. Neck circumference reflects upper body fat deposition. Hip measurement in women captures the sex-specific fat storage pattern driven by estrogen. The method works because people who carry more fat tend to have proportionally larger waist measurements relative to their height and neck. How accurate is it compared to other methods? DEXA scanning (Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) is considered the gold standard with roughly 1-2% error margin. Hydrostatic weighing (underwater weighing) achieves similar accuracy. Skinfold calipers, when used by an experienced technician, fall within 3-4% accuracy. The Navy method typically falls within 3-5% of DEXA results for most people, making it a reasonable field estimate that requires no special equipment. Its main weakness is that it may underestimate body fat in very lean individuals and overestimate in those with unusual fat distribution patterns. Healthy body fat ranges differ significantly between men and women due to essential fat requirements. For men, essential fat (the minimum needed for normal physiological function) is 2-5%, athletic range is 6-13%, fit is 14-17%, acceptable is 18-24%, and above 25% is considered obese. For women, essential fat is 10-13%, athletic is 14-20%, fit is 21-24%, acceptable is 25-31%, and above 32% is obese. Women carry more essential fat because of reproductive function and hormonal differences. Age also affects healthy ranges, with both men and women naturally gaining some fat with age. A 50-year-old male at 20% body fat is in a perfectly healthy range, while the same percentage in a 20-year-old male suggests room for improvement. Body fat percentage matters more than BMI for assessing health risk because it directly measures adiposity rather than inferring it from weight and height. Someone with a BMI of 27 could be an overfat sedentary office worker or a lean muscular athlete. Body fat percentage resolves that ambiguity and provides a clearer picture of metabolic health risk."
  formula: "Male: %BF = 86.010 × log10(waist - neck) - 70.041 × log10(height) + 36.76"
  formulaExplanation: "Female: %BF = 163.205 × log10(waist + hip - neck) - 97.684 × log10(height) - 78.387. All measurements in centimeters. Fat mass = weight × (%BF / 100). Lean mass = weight - fat mass."

faqs:
  - question: "How do I take accurate circumference measurements?"
    answer: "Use a flexible, non-elastic measuring tape. Measure your waist at navel level while standing relaxed (do not suck in your stomach). Measure your neck just below the larynx (Adam's apple) with the tape sloping slightly downward at the front. For women, measure hips at the widest point of the buttocks. Take each measurement twice and use the average. Measure in the morning before eating for the most consistent results. Keep the tape snug against the skin but not compressing the tissue, and ensure it stays parallel to the floor for waist and hip measurements."
  - question: "How accurate is the Navy body fat method?"
    answer: "The Navy method is accurate within 3-5% of DEXA scan results for most people, which makes it a practical estimation tool. It performs best for individuals in the average body fat range (15-30%) and can lose accuracy at the extremes. Very lean individuals (under 10% for men or under 18% for women) may see underestimation, while those with unusual fat distribution patterns may see larger errors. For tracking changes over time, the Navy method is quite reliable because measurement error tends to be consistent, meaning the trend in your results will accurately reflect real changes in body composition."
  - question: "What is a healthy body fat percentage for men?"
    answer: "For adult men, the generally accepted healthy range is 10-20% body fat, with variation based on age. Men in their 20s should aim for 10-18%, those in their 30s-40s for 12-20%, and men over 50 for 14-22%. Below 6% is considered competition-level leanness that is difficult and often unhealthy to maintain long-term. Essential fat for men is 2-5%, below which hormonal and immune function become compromised. Athletes typically maintain 6-13%, which supports both performance and health."
  - question: "What is a healthy body fat percentage for women?"
    answer: "For adult women, the healthy range is approximately 18-28% body fat, again varying with age. Women in their 20s should aim for 18-24%, those in their 30s-40s for 20-26%, and women over 50 for 22-30%. Essential fat for women is 10-13%, significantly higher than for men because of fat stored in breast tissue, around the uterus, and in other areas required for reproductive function. Dropping below essential fat levels can cause loss of menstrual cycles (amenorrhea), bone density loss, and hormonal disruption."
  - question: "Why is body fat percentage more useful than BMI?"
    answer: "BMI calculates a ratio of weight to height but cannot distinguish between fat mass and lean mass. A muscular person at 180 cm and 95 kg might have a BMI of 29.3 (overweight category) but only 14% body fat, which is athletic. Conversely, a sedentary person at the same height and 72 kg might have a normal BMI of 22.2 but carry 28% body fat due to low muscle mass. Body fat percentage eliminates this confusion by directly measuring what fraction of your body is adipose tissue, giving a far more meaningful indicator of health risk, physical appearance, and fitness level."
  - question: "How often should I measure my body fat?"
    answer: "Measuring body fat every 2-4 weeks provides meaningful data without excessive noise from daily fluctuations. Body composition changes slowly, even with aggressive training and nutrition protocols. Expecting visible body fat changes week to week leads to frustration and unreliable data. Take measurements under consistent conditions: same time of day, same hydration state (morning before eating works best), and same person taking the measurements. Record each result and look at the trend over 8-12 weeks rather than fixating on any single reading."

examples:
  - title: "Fit male assessment"
    scenario: "A 28-year-old male, 180 cm tall, weighing 82 kg, waist 81 cm, neck 38 cm"
    inputs:
      gender: "male"
      height: 180
      weight: 82
      waist: 81
      neck: 38
      unit: "metric"
    expectedResult: "Body fat: 15.2% | Fat mass: 12.5 kg | Lean mass: 69.5 kg | Category: Fit"
    explanation: "With a waist-to-neck difference of 43 cm and a height of 180 cm, the Navy formula estimates 15.2% body fat. This places him in the fit category for adult males. His 69.5 kg of lean mass indicates a solid muscular foundation. To reach the athletic range (below 14%), he would need to lose approximately 1-2 kg of fat while maintaining lean mass."
  - title: "Average female assessment"
    scenario: "A 34-year-old female, 165 cm tall, weighing 68 kg, waist 76 cm, hip 100 cm, neck 33 cm"
    inputs:
      gender: "female"
      height: 165
      weight: 68
      waist: 76
      hip: 100
      neck: 33
      unit: "metric"
    expectedResult: "Body fat: 27.4% | Fat mass: 18.6 kg | Lean mass: 49.4 kg | Category: Acceptable"
    explanation: "Using the female formula with waist (76) plus hip (100) minus neck (33) giving a combined measurement of 143 cm, the calculator estimates 27.4% body fat. This falls in the acceptable range for a woman in her 30s. Her lean mass of 49.4 kg is typical for a moderately active woman. To reach the fit category (below 24%), she would need to reduce body fat by approximately 2-3 kg through a moderate calorie deficit combined with resistance training."
