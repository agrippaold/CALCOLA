intro: "Building wealth through regular saving is straightforward math, but most people underestimate how much even modest amounts grow over time. This calculator combines your initial deposit with regular monthly contributions and applies compound interest to project your future balance. Whether you are building an emergency fund, saving for a down payment, or planning for retirement, seeing the actual numbers helps you set realistic goals and stay motivated."

  title: "How Savings Growth Is Calculated"
  content: "This calculator uses two separate compound interest formulas combined into one result. The initial deposit grows using the standard compound interest formula, while each monthly contribution is treated as a separate investment that compounds from the month it is deposited until the end of the period. The total future value is the sum of both components. The future value of regular contributions uses the annuity formula, which calculates how a stream of equal periodic payments grows with compound interest. If you deposit $200 per month at 5% annual interest for 20 years, those contributions alone grow to $82,207.25. Add a $5,000 initial deposit compounding over the same period, and the total reaches $95,560.61. The initial deposit contributes $13,353.36 of that total, while the $200 monthly contributions total $48,000 in deposits that earn $34,207.25 in interest. This demonstrates how consistent contributions combined with compound interest create growth that accelerates over time. The first $10,000 in interest takes roughly 8 years to accumulate, while the last $10,000 takes only about 3 years. Adjusting your contributions even slightly has a meaningful long-term impact. Increasing monthly savings from $200 to $250 (just $50 more) over 20 years at 5% adds approximately $10,276 to your final balance. The timing of when you start matters more than the amount. Starting 5 years earlier with $150 per month produces more than starting later with $250 per month over a shorter period. This principle underscores the importance of beginning as early as possible, even if the initial amounts feel small."
  formula: "FV = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) + PMT × [((1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1) / (r/n)]"
  formulaExplanation: "FV = future value, P = initial deposit, r = annual rate (decimal), n = compounds per year (12 for monthly), t = years, PMT = monthly contribution"

faqs:
  - question: "How much should I save each month?"
    answer: "The 50/30/20 budgeting rule suggests allocating 20% of your after-tax income to savings and debt repayment. If you take home $4,000 per month, that means $800 toward savings goals and debt payments. If you have no debt, the full $800 can go to savings. Even if you can only start with $100 per month, beginning the habit is more important than the initial amount. Increase your savings rate by 1% to 2% each time you get a raise."
  - question: "What interest rate should I expect on savings?"
    answer: "High-yield savings accounts currently offer between 4% and 5% APY, while traditional bank savings accounts pay 0.01% to 0.5%. Money market accounts fall somewhere in between. For longer-term savings (5+ years), a diversified investment portfolio has historically returned 7% to 10% annually before inflation, though with more volatility. Certificates of deposit (CDs) offer fixed rates typically between 3.5% and 5% for terms of 1 to 5 years."
  - question: "How long will it take to reach my savings goal?"
    answer: "The timeline depends on your goal amount, initial deposit, monthly contribution, and interest rate. As a rough guide: saving $500 per month at 5% annual interest, you would reach $50,000 in about 7.5 years, $100,000 in about 13 years, and $250,000 in about 25 years. Using this calculator with your specific numbers gives you an exact projection. Breaking a large goal into monthly milestones helps maintain motivation."
  - question: "Should I save or invest my money?"
    answer: "For money you need within 1 to 3 years (emergency fund, upcoming purchase), a high-yield savings account provides safety and liquidity. For goals 5+ years away, investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds has historically outperformed savings accounts by a wide margin. The 3-to-5-year range is a gray area where CDs, Treasury bonds, or conservative balanced funds may be appropriate. Never invest money you will need soon in volatile assets."
  - question: "Does the initial deposit matter more than monthly contributions?"
    answer: "Over long time periods, regular monthly contributions typically produce more wealth than a larger initial deposit alone. A $10,000 initial deposit with no further contributions at 6% for 30 years grows to $57,435. In contrast, $0 initial deposit with $200 monthly contributions at 6% for 30 years reaches $201,908. The combination of both is most powerful: $10,000 initial plus $200 monthly at 6% for 30 years yields $259,343."
  - question: "How does inflation affect my savings goals?"
    answer: "Inflation reduces purchasing power over time, meaning the money you save today will buy less in the future. If you need $50,000 in current dollars 20 years from now, you actually need about $90,000 assuming 3% average annual inflation. When setting savings goals for distant targets, add approximately 3% per year to your target amount to account for inflation. Real returns (after inflation) on savings accounts often hover near zero, which is why long-term savings benefit from higher-yielding investments."

examples:
  - title: "Emergency fund goal"
    scenario: "Building a $15,000 emergency fund with $2,000 initial deposit and $400 monthly at 4.5%"
    inputs:
      initialDeposit: 2000
      monthlyContribution: 400
      annualRate: 4.5
      years: 3
    expectedResult: "Future value: $17,269.83 | Interest earned: $869.83"
    explanation: "In 3 years, your $2,000 initial deposit plus $14,400 in contributions grow to $17,270 with $870 in interest earnings. You would reach the $15,000 target in about 31 months."
  - title: "Retirement savings over 30 years"
    scenario: "Starting with $5,000 and contributing $300 per month at 7% average annual return"
    inputs:
      initialDeposit: 5000
      monthlyContribution: 300
      annualRate: 7
      years: 30
    expectedResult: "Future value: $404,460.79 | Interest earned: $291,460.79"
    explanation: "Your $113,000 in total contributions (initial + monthly) grows to over $404,000 thanks to compound interest generating $291,461 in returns. This demonstrates why starting early with even modest monthly amounts builds substantial wealth."
  - title: "Down payment savings"
    scenario: "Saving for a $60,000 house down payment with $10,000 start and $800 monthly at 5%"
    inputs:
      initialDeposit: 10000
      monthlyContribution: 800
      annualRate: 5
      years: 5
    expectedResult: "Future value: $67,468.66 | Interest earned: $9,468.66"
    explanation: "Five years of disciplined saving turns $58,000 in contributions into $67,469 with nearly $9,500 in interest earnings. The initial $10,000 deposit contributes $2,763 of that interest through its longer compounding period."
